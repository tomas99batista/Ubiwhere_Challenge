## Introduction

This challenge was proposed by [Ubiwhere](https://www.ubiwhere.com/) for their backend-dev position.
It was developed in Python/Django, with the support of Django Rest Framework, JWT, Postgres + Postgis and Docker.
It's an API to manage Occurrences.

## Endpoints

### API Occurrence URLS

- **POST**: Add Occurrence
- **GET**: Get All Occurrences - If no filters are passed
- **GET**: Filter Occurrences by author/caregory/distance to a given point

  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/occurrences/`

- **PATCH**: Update state of Occurrence(occurrence_id=pk)
- **DELETE**: Delete Occurrence(occurrence_id=pk)
- **GET**: Get Occurrence(occurrence_id=pk)

  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/occurrences/<int:pk>/`

### Auth URLS

- **POST**: Login - Retrieves Auth Token
  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/login/`

- **POST**: Register - Creates new User
  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/register/`


### User URLS

- **GET**: Get All Users

  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/users/`

- **GET**: Get User by ID
- **DELETE**: Delete User by ID
  - `<ip_addr>:8000/api/users/<int:pk>/`

### Index (Endpoints table)

- `<ip_addr>:8000/`

### Swagger
- `<ip_addr>:8000/swagger/`

There is a swagger available. There is also a **redoc**: `<ip_addr>:8000/redoc/`.

In order to test the endpoints (as a normal_user or as a super_user), you first must obtain the Auth Token by logging in (using the endpoint on Swagger) and then go to "Authorize", insert the token, saving as: `Bearer <Token>`, as seen on the following image:

## Initial_Data

You can always access `<ip_addr>:8000/admin/` to see the data.

### Occurrences

`{ "occurrence_id": 1, "description": "Occurence - CONSTRUCTION - initial data, created by a initial user", "geographic_location": "POINT(25 -14)", "author": 1, "state": "To Validate", "category": "Construction", "creation_timestamp": "2020-09-25T17:06:57.001598Z", "update_timestamp": "2020-09-25T17:06:57.001598Z" }`

`{ "occurrence_id": 2, "description": "Occurence - INCIDENT - initial data, created by a initial user", "geographic_location": "POINT(23 -13)", "author": 1, "state": "To Validate", "category": "Incident", "creation_timestamp": "2020-09-25T17:06:57.001598Z", "update_timestamp": "2020-09-25T17:06:57.001598Z" }`

### Users

**Superuser**

- _Username_: 'admin'
- _Password_: 'admin'

**User**

- _Username_: 'userteste'
- _Password_: 'userteste'

## Installation

**Requirements to run**: Have `docker` & `docker-compose` installed.

### Clone the repository

Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/tomas99batista/Ubiwhere_Challenge.git

### Run containers

`docker-compose up -d --build`

### Clean containers

`docker-compose down -v`


## Postman

With the docker-compose running you can now test the endpoints with the given collection of Postman.

**URL**: <https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9124304/TVKHVaue>

It's possible to select between 2 environments: `admin_environment`, where the user is a superuser and, therefore, can DELETE Occurrences and Users and PATCH Occurrences ; and `normal_user_environment`, where the access is limited to this 2 options.

## Tests

There are 2 types of tests: tests to the Occurence model (`tests/test_models.py`) and to the API views (`tests/test_views.py`).

## Documentation

Available on `ubiwhere_challenge/docs/` there is documentation for the `models`, `serializers`, `views` and `urls`.

## CI

There is an workflow checking the build state on every commit to the master branch. It can be seen on <https://github.com/tomas99batista/Ubiwhere_Challenge/actions>
